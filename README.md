# Binary trees

This is the list of c programs that have functions that operate on binary tree nodes

**0-binary_tree_node.c:** creates a binary tree node

**1-binary_tree_insert_left.c:** creates and inserts binary tree node to left of parent

**2-binary_tree_insert_right.c:** creates and inserts binary tree node to right of parent

**3-binary_tree_delete.c:** deletes a binary tree

**4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c:** checks if a node of binary tree is a leaf

**5-binary_tree_is_root.c:** checks if a node of a binary tree is a root

**6-binary_tree_preorder.c:** traverses binary tree in preorder fashion executing function on nodes

**7-binary_tree_inorder.c:** traverses binary tree in inorder fashion executing function on nodes

**8-binary_tree_postorder.c:** traverses binary tree in postorder fashion executing function on nodes

**9-binary_tree_height.c:** calculates height of binary tree at given root

**10-binary_tree_depth.c:** fetches the depth of a binary tree node

**11-binary_tree_size.c:** calculates the size of the tree(no of nodes)

**12-binary_tree_leaves.c:** calculates the no of leaves

**13-binary_tree_nodes.c:** calculates no of internal nodes

**14-binary_tree_balance.c:** calculates the balance factor of the node

**15-binary_tree_is_full.c:** tests if the binary tree is full binary tree

**16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c:** tests if the binary tree is perfect binary tree

**17-binary_tree_sibling.c:** retrieves the sibling of node in binary tree if it exists

**18-binary_tree_uncle.c:** retrieves the uncle of node in binary tree if it exists
