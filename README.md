# Binary trees

This is the list of c programs that have functions that operate on binary tree nodes

**0-binary_tree_node.c:** creates a binary tree node

**1-binary_tree_insert_left.c:** creates and inserts binary tree node to left of parent

**2-binary_tree_insert_right.c:** creates and inserts binary tree node to right of parent

**3-binary_tree_delete.c:** deletes a binary tree

**4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c:** checks if a node of binary tree is a leaf

**5-binary_tree_is_root.c:** checks if a node of a binary tree is a root

**6-binary_tree_preorder.c:** traverses binary tree in preorder fashion executing function on nodes

**7-binary_tree_inorder.c:** traverses binary tree in inorder fashion executing function on nodes

**8-binary_tree_postorder.c:** traverses binary tree in postorder fashion executing function on nodes

**9-binary_tree_height.c:** calculates height of binary tree at given root

**10-binary_tree_depth.c:** fetches the depth of a binary tree node
